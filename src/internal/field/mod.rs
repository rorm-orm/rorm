//! The various field traits and their proxy.
//!
//! # Introduction
//! Rorm's main entry point is the [`Model`] trait and its derive macro.
//! It takes a struct and generates the code to represent this struct as a database table.
//! To do so each of the struct's fields need to be represented in some way.
//!
//! For each field the derive macro declares a unit struct (i.e. an empty struct) to represent it.
//! This empty struct is then "populated" with the field's information using various traits defined in this module.
//!
//! # Trait Implementation Flow
//! As stated in the introduction, the derive macro generates an unit struct per field.
//! It the proceeds to implement then [`Field`] trait on this empty struct.
//! Therefore, [`Field`] encapsulates all information the macro can gather.
//! This includes:
//! - the name (a db safe version of it, to be precise)
//! - its "raw type" ("raw" because the macro can't make any deductions about the type)
//! - the various annotations inside a `#[rorm(...)]` attribute
//!
//! #### Small illustration
//! ```text
//! #[derive(Model)]
//! struct User {
//!     id: i32,
//!     ...
//! }
//! ```
//! will produce something like
//! ```text
//! struct __User_id;
//! impl Field for __User_id {
//!     type RawType = i32;
//!     const NAME: &'static str = "id";
//!     ...
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! From there the various methods and associated type from [`FieldType`] take over.
//! TODO more docs
