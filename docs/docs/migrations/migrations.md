# Migrations

## Migrations

Migrations are the result of changes to your database models.

In `drorm`, migrations are represented by an agreed-upon declarative format
using [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) as file format.
These files can be generated by the [`makemigrations` tool](makemigrations.md).

You can also take a look at the more 
[in-depth introduction](migration_files.md) to the file format if you
want to explore more options.

## Why file based migrations?

Some ORMs choose to use an auto-migrator that tries to check the current
state of the database scheme and modifies it, until it matches with its
model declaration.

In the beginning this sounds like a smart idea. 

- there are no random files lying around.
- your app is able to apply migrations on startup

but there are some drawbacks to this method:

- magic applied by the auto-migrator is difficult to understand
- reversing changes back to a defined state is impossible
- no easy way to insert arbitrary sql, that should be executed once
